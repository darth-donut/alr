In all the experiments listed below, we have at least 3 main files:

1. `run.sh` which specifies what arguments were used to run the python file
2. `train.py` which is the python file that contains the driver code to run the experiment 
3. `environment.yml` is a conda-specific environment file. It installs the
   specific version of `alr` used for that particular experiment. Note, it
   also installs the exact version of other auxiliary packages we use (e.g.
   pytorch, matplotlib, numpy, etc.)

To re-run our experiments, start by creating an exact replica of 
the conda environment using `conda env create -n <env name> -f environment.yml` for that particular experiment.
Then, run `train.py` using the exact arguments specified in `run.sh` after loading the newly minted conda environment.

We mapped each figure or table to the corresponding experiment directory below. The code used to plot figures is placed under the figures folder.
